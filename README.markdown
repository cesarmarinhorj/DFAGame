DFA Builder
===========

This allows building a DFA representing a simple game.

## Use

To start the program, run 

    $ ./View.py 
	
To get a basic idea of how to use it, go to `File > Open` and open the
"intro.game" file. Then click on `Play > Start Game` and follow the
instructions. 
	
## Requirements	

This requires Python 2 (It will not work with Python 3). It also
requires pygtk and pycairo. 

See the [wiki](https://github.com/jmikkola/DFAGame/wiki/DFAGame) on github for more details.
