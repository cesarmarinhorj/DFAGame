DFA Builder
===========

This allows building a DFA representing a simple game.


## TODO

+ Decide how to output games

+ Render a graph
  + Figure out how to display vertices
  + Figure out how to lay out vertices
	+ Force based model?
  + Figure out how to draw edges (must be arrows)
  + Figure out how to make verices clickable
  
+ Create logic layer connecting graph to model
